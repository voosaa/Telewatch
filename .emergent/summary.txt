The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive Telegram Bot Monitoring System from a basic FastAPI/React/MongoDB template, iterating through feature development and bug fixes based on user feedback. Initially, the core bot functionality and a web dashboard were implemented, covering group and watchlist management, message filtering, and logging. A critical bug preventing the Telegram bot from starting was identified and fixed by correctly configuring webhooks and adding polling, along with replacing slash commands with inline buttons for a better user experience. Following this, a Message Forwarding System was added, extending the bot's capabilities to forward filtered messages to designated channels. Most recently, a major architectural shift to a multi-tenant system was undertaken, including backend authentication (JWT, RBAC, data isolation) and initial frontend integration for login/registration and protected routes. The current state is that the multi-tenant backend is functional, and the frontend has been largely rewritten to support it, but the user has reported the absence of a subscription page that would manage organization plans.

<product_requirements>
The user's core requirement was to create a comprehensive Telegram Bot Monitoring System from scratch, leveraging a provided FastAPI/React/MongoDB template. The system needed a dashboard and a Telegram bot interface.
Initial core features explicitly requested and implemented:
1.  **Group Management:** Add/remove monitored Telegram groups.
2.  **Watchlist of Accounts:** Manage users to monitor with keyword filters.
3.  **Filtering & Forwarding:** Real-time message detection and forwarding (forwarding was initially planned but implemented in a later phase).
4.  **Message & Media Support:** Handle text, images, videos, documents.
5.  **Logging & Archiving:** Store messages in a database with search.

Subsequent features requested by the user:
1.  **Message Forwarding System:** To forward monitored messages to designated channels/groups with source attribution and rate limiting.
2.  **Multi-tenant System:** To transform the platform into a scalable SaaS, enabling multiple organizations with data isolation, user authentication (registration, login, JWT), role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Viewer), and organization/user management interfaces.
The system implicitly requires a subscription management page for different organization plans (Free, Pro, Enterprise) mentioned during the multi-tenant planning.

    -   **Importance:** This is the core of the FastAPI backend, defining all API endpoints, database interactions, Telegram bot logic (message handling, command processing, webhook/polling), and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Initially, a complete implementation of the 5 core features was added, including API routes for group and watchlist management, message logging, and bot command handlers.
        -   Later, comprehensive webhook setup and polling mechanisms were integrated for robust Telegram bot connectivity.
        -   Slash commands were replaced with inline keyboard button handling.
        -   Message forwarding logic was added, including new database models for  and APIs for their management.
        -   Crucially, a multi-tenant architecture was implemented:
            -   New models for , , , , , ,  were introduced/updated to include  and  fields.
            -   Authentication routes (, ) were added using JWT for token generation and  for password hashing.
            -   All existing API routes were modified to be protected and scope data by  using dependency injection for the .
            -   A database migration function was added to update existing data with  and .
            -   Duplicate routes/functions were identified and removed to ensure the multi-tenant versions were correctly used.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Stores environment variables like  and .
    -   **Changes Made:**  was added to support the new authentication system.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The main React component defining the application's layout, routing, and overall UI.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Initially built out the dashboard, group management, watchlist management, and message archive components.
        -   Frontend error handling and success/error message display were improved for group and watchlist forms.
        -   New navigation and dashboard sections were added for Forwarding statistics and management.
        -   Significantly refactored and largely rewritten to integrate the multi-tenant system:
            -   Incorporates  for user session management.
            -   Uses  for secured routes.
            -   Integrates , , , and  components.
            -   Removes old, non-multi-tenant specific components that were causing duplication errors.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing a comprehensive **Multi-Tenant System** for the application. The backend for this system is fully implemented and tested, including:
-   **User Authentication:** Registration and login with JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing.
-   **Data Isolation:** All data (groups, watchlists, messages, forwarding destinations) is now correctly scoped to specific organizations (), ensuring that users from one organization cannot access data from another.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Backend endpoints enforce permissions based on , , and  roles.
-   **API Endpoints:** All existing APIs were updated to enforce authentication and multi-tenancy.

On the frontend, the AI engineer was integrating this multi-tenant functionality. This involved:
-   **Authentication Infrastructure:** Creating React Context () for managing user sessions and providing login/registration functionality (, ).
-   **Protected Routes:** Implementing a  component to restrict access to authenticated users.
-   **Main Application Rewrite:** A substantial rewrite of  to incorporate the authentication flow, manage user state, and conditionally render components based on authentication status.
-   **Organization Management Components:** Creating placeholder components like  and  to eventually manage multi-tenant aspects from the UI.

The last action was the AI engineer restarting the frontend services after a major rewrite of  and associated components. However, the user's immediate feedback (i dont see any subscription page) indicates that while the core multi-tenant backend and foundational frontend authentication are in place, a critical UI component for managing subscription plans (Free, Pro, Enterprise, which were part of the multi-tenancy planning) is still missing. The current state is that the application now supports multi-tenancy at its core, but the user-facing interface for subscription management is not yet available, marking it as the next implicit feature to be built.
